# USA-COVID19-

Question of Interest: Which variables are associated with USA's COVID19 total cases.

CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) is one of the most severe communicable disease from the entire human history. It spread out to More than 200 countries and more than 20,000,000 people are infected until 2020 August 6th and counting.

COVID-19 starts from Wuhan, China and it spread out to nearby countries rapidly. After that, several infectees move to Italy, so entire Europe starts to having a lot of COVID19 patients.

However, the biggest issue is USA. After Europe's infection(especially Italy), COVID19 starts to move South, and North America. As a result, more than 5,000,000 cases are occurred in USA which is almost 25% of total cases. (followed by data until 2020 August 6th) At this point, I wonder that which variables are associated most with USA's COVID-19 total cases.

I used data fromÂ https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/CA/PST045221, and https://datausa.io/coronavirus. (I will cite those address more specifically in my portfolio file) 
I did not consider the Death rate or Death count from USA. I only use result of cases. I use cases by race, age group, sex, social status.
